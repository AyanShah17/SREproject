# SREproject ðŸš€

A containerized Python FastAPI web application designed for fast deployment and scalability. This project demonstrates best practices for building, running, and deploying lightweight web apps using Docker.

## Features
- Minimal FastAPI web server (`app.py`)
- Lightweight Docker container
- Easy to run locally or inside Docker
- Clean project structure
- Logging and metrics integration
- Helpful bash scripts to simplify running and deployment

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3.11**
- **FastAPI** â€“ Modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+
- **Docker** â€“ Containerization
- **Bash** â€“ Automation scripts for running and managing the app

## Project Structure

```bash
SREproject/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                # Main FastAPI application
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile            # Instructions for Docker image
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt      # Python package dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/              # Bash scripts to build, run, and manage the app
â”œâ”€â”€ logs/                 # Directory for application logs
```

## Getting Started

### Running Locally

#### Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AyanShah17/SREproject.git
   cd SREproject
   ```

#### Create a virtual environment (optional):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate 
```

#### On Windows: 

```bash
cd sreproject/venv/Scripts/
activate
```
or

```bash
cd sreproject
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Start the app with Uvicorn:

```bash 
uvicorn app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

#### Visit:

```bash
http://localhost:8000
```

### Running with Docker

#### Build the Docker image :

```bash 
docker build -t sreproject .
```

#### Run the container :

```bash 
docker run -p 8000:8000 sreproject
```
#### Open your browser at :

   ```bash 
   http://localhost:8000 
   ```

## Testing the App

- Once running, the FastAPI app should respond at the root (/) route. 

#### You can test it using:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000
```
- Or visit it in your browser.

## Using Bash Scripts

- The scripts/ directory contains helpful bash scripts to automate common tasks:

- scripts/metrics.sh â€“ Script to start the No. of visiting of client and run the logging of the Visits.
- scripts/monitor.sh â€“ Script to start the monitoring of Prometheus_client UPTIME and run the logging of the UPTIME.

### To execute these scripts:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
./scripts/metrics.sh
./scripts/monitor.sh
```

## Logs
- Application logs are stored in the logs/ directory. These logs capture important runtime information and can help with debugging or monitoring the app.

- Ensure you have appropriate permissions to write to this directory when running the app.

## Tips & Troubleshooting

- Port Binding: Ensure the app runs on 0.0.0.0 so itâ€™s reachable inside Docker (as shown in the Uvicorn command).

- Memory Limits: Optimize dependencies and runtime if running in constrained environments.

- Make sure you have uvicorn installed (pip install uvicorn).
